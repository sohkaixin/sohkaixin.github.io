	She looked out of the dingy apartment window with a sigh. Another day, another night. She squinted at the hazy view, unsure whether it was from the layer of dust and grime caked on the glass or the perpetual smog that hung over the city like a hazy grey veil. The disused windowpane squealed as she opened it and poked her head out. She took a deep breath—

	—and promptly burst out coughing, after inhaling a lungful of smoky fumes. 

	She gazed up at the sky, which was a murky, oleaginous black that had the sort of shiny, metallic sheen as if someone had spilled petroleum oil all over it. All she could see were a few small scraps of sky. Everything else was obfuscated by the shadowy silhouettes of towering skyscrapers and apartment buildings. The light was blinding, from the roads, the street lights, the cars, the windows.
	
	There was so much light, and so much darkness.

	Another day, another night. She didn’t know how long more she could go on like this. Hustling and bustling non-stop. Always trying to reach to the top, to climb to a higher position, a higher pay, a higher penthouse apartment unit. Always trying to be good, to be better, to be the best. Always searching and yearning for something but not knowing what.

	All at once, the lights in her apartment began to flicker. Then everything went pitch black. A blackout.

	She had enough. She had to get out. 

	She got out of her apartment and got into her car. She drove and drove and drove, until the towering skyscrapers turned to towering mountains, until the meandering roads turned into meandering rivers, and until the city turned to countryside. 

	When she finally stopped, she stepped out of the car and took a deep breath.

	Cool, crisp air, so fresh it almost tasted sweet. Nothing like the suffocating smog of the city. There was no pollution here. No streetlights, no fluorescent lamps, no garish neon glow from billboards and signs. But as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness, she saw them. 

	Stars. 

	Clusters of sparkling starlight that looked like a thousand tiny diamonds, strung together with glimmering silver thread, embroidered like a glittering tapestry of constellations. 

	Her eyes were shining. Reflections of starlight, happiness or unshed tears; maybe a combination of all three. 

	Here, lost in the darkness, she had finally found what she was searching for all along.
	She had found the stars.
	She had found the light.
	She had found herself.</p>
